# A simple planning game

A planning game for project planning sessions. Find the live version at https://secret-oasis-96580.herokuapp.com/hello

This is mainly an experiment in using Elm and Elixir/Phoenix for a multi-user application. Don't expect anything functional.

## Original Phoenix instructions

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
